2.32-Bit System:

char: 1 byte
short: 2 bytes
int: 4 bytes
long: 4 bytes
long long: 8 bytes
float: 4 bytes
double: 8 bytes
long double: Typically 12 or 16 bytes
Pointers: 4 bytes (since it's a 32-bit system, addresses are 32 bits)

64-Bit System:

char: 1 byte
short: 2 bytes
int: 4 bytes
long: 8 bytes
long long: 8 bytes
float: 4 bytes
double: 8 bytes
long double: Typically 16 bytes
Pointers: 8 bytes (since it's a 64-bit system, addresses are 64 bits)
